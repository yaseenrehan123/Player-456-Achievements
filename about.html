                Hey! If you are curious about who's crazy enough to make such a thing than you are at the right place,
                I am just a random squid game fan who decided to try and share my creativity, i also have a passion for coding 
                so as soon as i got this idea i was like 'yeah no one's probably did this before' and so i just decided to make it
                no matter how absurd it is <i class='bx bx-wink-smile wink-icon'></i>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="heading">
            <h1>How I Came Up With The Idea?</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="about-me-content">
            <p>
                It was when i recently watched season 2 for the first time, while also playing some of my favorite games
                and i absolutely loved the feeling of getting a new achievement and the achievement tab just popping out,
                I even played some 'squid game' games on playstore and suddenly got the idea to turn it into a game like achievement.

                While this project was just a fun hobby work of mine and certainly not any attempt to self-promotion or anything,
                for those who are interested in checking out more about me you can certainly do so
